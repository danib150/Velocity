Velocity fork designed for premium client-side uuid.

Velocity is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

## Building

Velocity is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org). We recommend using the
wrapper script (`./gradlew`) as our CI builds using it.

It is sufficient to run `./gradlew build` to run the full build cycle.

## Running

Once you've built Velocity, you can copy and run the `-all` JAR from
`proxy/build/libs`. Velocity will generate a default configuration file
and you can configure it from there.

Alternatively, you can get the proxy JAR from the [downloads](https://papermc.io/downloads#Velocity)
page.
